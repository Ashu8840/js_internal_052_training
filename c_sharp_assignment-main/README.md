Day 6 Assignment - C# Delegates

Completed two practical assignments on C# delegates for real world scenarios.

The first assignment is about a Smart Online Shopping Discount System. I created a Product class to store product details like id, name and price. Then a Customer class that has a customer type field which can be either occasional or regular. Using delegates, I implemented different discount strategies where occasional customers get a festival discount of 17 percent off and regular customers get a premium discount of 28 percent off. The Shopping class applies the appropriate discount based on customer type and shows the final price after discount calculation.

The second assignment covers a Smart Payment Gateway System. I designed a system where customers can pay using three different methods: credit card, UPI or net banking. Using payment processor delegates, I created methods for each payment type that handle the transaction processing differently. The system can switch between payment methods dynamically based on customer choice and processes the payment accordingly.

Both assignments demonstrate practical use of delegates to implement different strategies and make the code flexible for handling multiple processing methods.
